# SeedGerm-VIG
Jie Dai, Zhenjie Wen, Ji Zhou

## The main files are as follows:

### Dataset <br>
(1) The 'SeedVig-phase' dataset for object detection, predicting seed-level germination phases (such as imbibition, protrusion, radicle emergence, and seedling establishment); <br>

(2) The 'SeedVig-traits' dataset for semantic segmentation, predicting masks of seeds without roots and seedling, seeds with roots and seedling, and seedling only.

### Jupyter notebook <br> 
Python-based source code that contains the image pre-processing, the model integration and execution.

### Outputs of the AI model <br> 
(1) The YOLOv8x-Germ model and output results for germination phase detection; <br>

(2) The U-net models and output results for masks of seeds without roots and seedling, seeds with roots and seedling, and seedling only.

We also uploaded all the image series used, with two example image series packaged separately.
